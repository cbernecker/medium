    "# Example Optimize Multithreading\n",
    "Next, we'll optimize this with a multithreading approach to improve the processing time. To optimize the above example using multithreading, we can use Python's concurrent.futures module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. In this optimized script, we use `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a pool of threads. The `executor.map` function distributes the `square_number` function across the threads, processing the numbers in parallel. By setting `max_workers` to 5, we allow up to 5 threads to run concurrently, which should significantly reduce the total processing time."
